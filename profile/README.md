# Functional Roof

__Single-layer multi-function (solar energy provider and agricultural) roof__

The purpose of the F-Roof is to provide the following:

- Protect the house from rain and snow.
- Provide solar energy to the house.
- Provide food (vegetables) for the house's inhabitants.
- Utilize a minimal amount of materials (solar panels and plant pots are the roof's structure).
