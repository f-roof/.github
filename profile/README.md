# Functional Roof

__Single-layer multi-function (solar energy provider and agricultural) roof__

The purpose of the __F-Roof__ is to provide the following:

- Protect the house from rain and snow.
- Provide solar energy to the house.
- Provide food (vegetables) for the house's inhabitants.
- Utilize a minimal amount of materials (solar panels and plant pots are the roof's structure).

## Why F-Roof?

Because:

- Most of the roofs have a single function: to protect the house from rain and snow.
- Ground-level soil should be used for growing trees not vegetables.
- Existing roof-gardens have too many unnecesarly layers, thus being expensive.
- Wood should not be utilized construction purposes. Trees are more important than that!

## Maker

## Project location

Street: **Gheorghe Lazăr 9**, town: **Cugir**, country: **Romania**. [Google Maps location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KsL6PsEaSgzJYHLw7)

## Materials, tools and software

Brief instructions are given below. More details are in the links.

### Materials

Almost the entire roof is made from metal.
All units are in mm.

- 80x40x3 rectangular tubes.
- 60x40x3 rectangular tubes.
- T40 profiles.
- T50 profiles.
- L40 profiles.
- Solar panels. I have *Hyundai 485W*.
- Rectangular gutters (filled with soil for plants). I used [Lindab RTRA](https://www.lindab.com/Catalog/building-products/rainwater-systems/gutter/gutter-rectangular/rtra/?sort=popularity&display=16&page=1).
- Roof panels and some wooden boards (if you do not have enough solar panels or gutters).
- Some wooden boards (used as steps at the end of the gutters).
- M8x100, M8x60 screws (stainless steel), auto-drilling screws.
- M8 auto-lock nuts stainless steel.
- Paint.
- Mastic (around the solar panels).

The entire BOM is [here](bom.md). Note: the lengths are computed for my house, so they may be different for yours.

### Tools

- Band saw (able to cut 80x40mm rectangular tube at 52 degrees angle). I have a [PILOUS ARG 130 mobil](https://www.pilous.cz/en/metal/bandsaws/manual/arg-130-mobil).
- Drill machine. I have a [Milwaukee M18 FDD3](https://www.milwaukeetool.com/).
- Welding machine. I have a [Lorch Handy 160](https://lorch.eu).
- Screwdriver (preferably electric).
- Drill bits (8mm, 5.5mm, 5mm, 4.8mm, 4mm, 3.5mm, etc) of various lengths.

### Software

- [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) - for design.
- [Real Cut 1D](https://optimalprograms.com/realcut1d.htm) - for minimizing the waste when cutting bars.

## Build instructions

- cut, weld, drill, mount.
More details soon...

## Cost

- Prices are for a roof of (approx.) 6.5m length and 7 meters depth.

- Prices do not include manufacturing (which I did it by myself) and tools (which I have).

- Prices are specific to my region (Cugir, Romania). I have not searched for better prices from distant stores. Prices do not include shipping (because I purchased the materials from nearby stores and the shipping was free).
